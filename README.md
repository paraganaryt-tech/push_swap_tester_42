# Push_swap

## Description
The goal of this project is to sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a limited set of instructions, aiming for the lowest possible number of moves. This project implements the "Chunks" sorting algorithm. It also includes the bonus `checker` program to verify that the stack is sorted correctly.

## Instructions
**Mandatory**
1. Run make to compile.
2. Execute: ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8

**Bonus**
1. Run make bonus to compile the checker.
2. Execute: ./checker 2 1 3 6 5 8
3. Or combine them: ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

## Resources
*   **Algorithm:** Chunks Algorithm.
*   **AI Usage:** Used to generate checks and run some edge cases.
